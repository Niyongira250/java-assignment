java programming
--------------------------------------------------------------
This project consists of a collection of Java programs that demonstrate fundamental programming concepts. I have implemented various algorithms and functionalities, including:

Diamond Pattern: A program that takes user input for the number of rows and displays a diamond shape made of asterisks.

Array Manipulations: Programs that reverse an array, find the largest element in an array, and calculate the average of array elements.

Conditional Logic: Programs that determine if a number is positive, negative, or zero, as well as checking the grade of a student and providing feedback based on the input.

Each program is designed to enhance understanding of Java syntax, control structures, and array handling. The code is organized in separate files for clarity, and each program includes comments for better understanding. This project serves as a practical exercise in applying Java programming skills.

enjoy!
